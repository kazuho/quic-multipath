I think we might also want to add a sentence in the Sec. of \"one packet number space\" explicitly specifying that \"for single PN, use ACK instead of ACK_MP\", and change some texts in the ACK_MP frame section that is related to zero-length CID (the current draft says \"if the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with 0-length Connection ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames\". ).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we really need to send \"abandon path\" in both directions?

How does the server know whether it should create a new path or not?\r\n\r\nI think in single PN, sending \"abandon path\" in both directions is helpful. When the client sends \"PATH_ABANDON\", it promises not to send non-probing packets in the current activity cycle. It could send probing packets to reactivate the path a moment later if the client thinks the network environment has changed. After sending out \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client should still be able to receive packets from the server for a while on that path because there may be the server's inflight packets on that path. It was not until the client sees the server's \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client then knows that no more server's data is to be expected except for some out-of-order packets. So after receiving \"PATH_ABANDON\", the endpoint can start preparing to free memories and clear path stats allocated for that path. The time interval from seeing \"PATH_ABANDON\" to actually releasing relevant resources is going to be an important parameter, and yes, 10-30 seconds is too long. What would be a more appropriate number for this interval? \r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the single space case, the logical test may be to check the sequence numbers of the packet. If the sequence number of the new packet is greater than that of the path_abandon, then the client is reactivating a path that was abandoned previously. Maybe the client connected again to the same network, after some disconnected interval. The server can start sending on the reactivated path. If the packet number is lower than that of the path abandon, then the server should not reactivate the path.\r\n\r\nDoes it imply that we need to track the packet number of the PATH_ABANDON for a path that is closed? When a path is in a closed state, the server may reject any newly received packets unless it is a probing packet (back to our path initialization process). In this way, it should be OK to forget any info related to that path in the last activity cycle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the multiple space case, if the CID is defined, there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n",

As the problem is similar to FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK when TCP closes, I kept the ACK in the graph (because the path_id_type=2 refers to the path where the packet is traveling, we want to make sure it is acked before we close the path.). Regarding the resource, I think if we keep a unified receive record, which is not per-path, yes, we can discard the sending resources. But if we have some path stats (e.g. how many packets received in total in this current activity cycle), we need to keep these data structures until we are sure that the peer is not going to send more packets on that path. Indeed, it depends on the implementation, but I feel it is generally helpful to have PATH_ABANDON sent in both directions.

This is basically the same issue as determining whether a connection is broken, just applied to a path. But that is not entirely sufficient, because the server needs to also infer whether the client still wants to use that path.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of non probing packets is just an heuristic. The server observes that if the client is not using the path, and deduces that it should not be using it itself. That's not a bad heuristic, but it requires the client to send some kinds of \"keep alive\" if it wants the server to continue using a path. We may debate how often that should happen. Maybe reuse the same timeout as for jettisoning paths.\r\n\r\nAnother solution may be for the client to tell something like \"please don't use that path anymore\", but that requires adding a new frame as part of the core multipath specification. In draft-liu, this was done with a specialization of the \"path status\", setting the status to \"Abandon\". Maybe we should just use a simplified for of the PATH_STATUS, leaving out the complexities of managing priorities for the advanced scheduling drafts:\r\n```\r\nABANDON_PATH Frame {\r\n  Type (i) = TBD,\r\n  Path_identifier (i),\r\n  Error Code (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase Length (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase (..),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However if we think one packet number space is mandatory to implement, it would make more sense to have it the other way around and allow fallback to one packet number space, namely if the client ask for two packet number spaces but the server supports only one but would also lead to a successful negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this?",

The first thing is to allow people more freedom. If some implementors only want to use one option, they just need to implement one code branch.  Second, single packet number space requires the modification of loss detection algorithm, the way how rtt is sampled (the overall largest ack may not be the largest acked packet on a given path), and some delayed ACK strategies, which might take additional effort. People may also want to avoid round-robin scheduling in single PN as it creates a lot of holes in the ack range, so certain things regarding performance get coupled. Christian introduced many good practices and we are currently learning from it, so we probably need more experience on that.  ",

          "body": "Adding the option to negotiate is a very good solution at this point. It would be helpful to hear more people's implementation experience. To avoid failure for interop tests, I suggest that we could negotiate the transport parameter like this: use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more PN spaces.\r\n\r\n- 0x0: don't support multi-path\r\n- 0x1: only support multiple PN spaces for multi-path\r\n- 0x2: only support one PN space for multi-path\r\n- 0x3: support both one PN space and multiple PN space \r\n\r\nThe client could send all these 4 values in the enable_multipath transport parameter which depends on what kind of modes it supports. If the server just support one mode(such as one PN space), it could return 0x2 so that the client knows how to do next. If the server support both, it could choose 0x1 or 0x2 as it prefers, and make sure that the server don't return 0x3 as it need to decide which mode to choose. In 0x2 mode, the endpoints must not use 0-length CID.\r\n\r\nThen for people who just want one PN space, it would be ok to just support 0x2 mode. For the other guys who don't use 0-length Connection ID and want to get less overhead for ack ranges, they could choose to use 0x1 mode. And for people who want to support both 0-length CID and multiple PN spaces, they could choose 0x3 and of course it will add more modification in the implementation.\r\nMaybe this could meet everyone's need for experiments. \r\n\r\n",

Additionally, since multi-path would be a negotiated feature/extension, that would mean all connections that don't negotiate the feature would have the \"old\" model/logic, where as the connections that do would have the new encryption/decryption logic.

With non-zero-length Connection IDs at both ends, it is indeed possible that over a same path/5-tuple, the client reaches the server using a DCID with a sequence number that is different from the sequence number of the DCID used by the server to reach the client (e.g., Figure 2). In the current draft, we consider that if the connection ID is zero-length, the packet number space identifier is 0, and applying multiple packet number spaces is thus not possible.\r\n\r\nI believe we can do better than this. Consider the situation where the client uses a non-zero length DCID to reach the server while the server uses zero-length DCID. In this case, it is the client that initiates the usage of a path with path validation, associating a server-provided non-zero-length DCID to reach the server. Once the first client's packet reaches the server on the new path, the server can associate the client's 5-tuple to the sequence number of the used Destination Connection ID, making a valid Packet Number Space Identifier. The client can easily map incoming packets on the 5-tuple to the associated DCID sequence number.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?",

For me, the issue is that when an endpoint decides to close a path, it is probably due to that the path condition is getting worse, which also means that further communication on that path may fail. When we use non-zero CID, as we should have at least one path that is working (if no path is working, the connection will be closed), and we are not constraint to send PATH_ABANDON frame on the same path that we want to close, the sender should be able to receive the ACK of PATH_ABANDON. But when we use null CID, we use path_id_type 0x02, which refers to the path where the packet is coming from, and hence, we are constraint to send PATH_ABANDON on the same path we want to close. In such a case, it is likely that the ACK of PATH_ABANDON will not be received, resulting in the \"half-open\" problem. Therefore, we should say sth like \"when the sender moves into the \"ABANDON_SENT\" state, and after 3RTO, it should close the path even if it hasn't seen the PATH_ABANDON sent from its peer\". \r\n",

In\r\nthis case, QUIC must select the path over which each frame will be sent. Many PS strategies\r\nare possible and the best one will depend on the application's requirements. The PS should\r\nhave access to (an abstraction of) the congestion control state of each path to be able to determine\r\nwhether a path has enough capacity to carry a new packet. The PS also needs to have access to the\r\npath's MTU as different paths do not necessarily have the same MTU. A simple PS is a round-robin\r\nscheduler that checks the congestion window of a path before sending a QUIC packet.\r\nAnother sample PS is an algorithm that selects the path whose congestion window is open and\r\nthat has the smallest round-trip-time. This is the PS used by the Linux implementation of Multipath\r\nTCP. Note that a multipath QUIC PS will probably treat control and data packets differently. For\r\nexample, a PS could favor low delay paths to send acknowledgments and higher bandwidth\r\nones for data packets. A companion draft\r\n{{I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers}} provides several general-purpose multipath\r\npacket schedulers. \r\n```",

For example, you may have a mental model of an application use one stream for video, another for audio, and another for data, but there are applications that use one separate stream for each video frame, leading to very different ways of doing scheduling. Or, we see what Ali Baba has done for video download, using redundant transmission on multiple paths to minimize buffering of videos. That's very interesting, but is very different from simply scheduling streams on specific paths. \r\n\r\nWe are barely scratching the surface of what can be possible. Scheduling decisions depend on applications, and applications are not blocked. Information about priorities, expected completion time and the like can be carried in application protocols. Nothing stops developers of QUIC stack from providing applications with scheduling control APIs. Delaying standardization of scheduling will not stop deployments.

There are deployments and applications that would like to restrict the amount of data or bandwidth that is sent on a given path. A typical example is a smartphone that does not want to use too much data on cellular but has no restriction on WiFi. As in MPTCP, we need a connection-level MAX_DATA that limits the amount of data which can be in flight. In MPTCP, this corresponds to the receive window and the same window is advertised over all subflows. We could not do better than this within the IETF. \r\n\r\nIn MPQUIC, there is an opportunity to send a per-path MAX_DATA to restrict the utilization of a path or define other control frames to specify the maximum allowed bandwidth per path. \r\n\r\nWe might discuss whether we should include this functionality in version 1 or leave it to another draft.\r\n\r\n",

A client constructs packets using any previously unused active connection ID, taken from either the \r\n  preferred_address transport parameter or a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\n  As soon as path validation succeeds, the client SHOULD begin sending all future packets to the new server address using the \r\n  new connection ID and discontinue use of the old server address.

          "body": "The main issues mentioned so far:\r\n\r\n* Efficiency. One number space per path should be more efficient, because implementations can directly reuse the loss-recovery logic specified for QUIC\r\n* ACK size. Single space leads to lots of out of order delivery, which causes ACK sizes to grow\r\n* Simplicity of code. Single space can be implemented without adding mane new code paths to uni-path QUIC\r\n* Shorter header. Single space works well with NULL length CID\r\n\r\nThe picoquic implementation shows that \"efficiency\" and \"ack size\" issues of single space implementations can be mitigated. However, that required significant improvements in the code:\r\n\r\n* to obtain good loss efficiency, picoquic remembers not just the path on which a packet was sent, but also the order of the packet on this path, i.e. a \"virtual sequence number\". The loss detection logic then operates on that virtual sequence number.\r\n\r\n* to contain ACK size, picoquic implements a prioritization logic to select the most important ranges in an ACK, avoid acking the same range more than 3 or 4 times, and keep knowledge of already acknowledged ranges so range coalescing works.\r\n\r\nI think these improvements are good in general, and I will keep them in the implementations whether we go for single space or not. The virtual sequence number is for example useful if the CID changes for reasons not related to path changes in multiple number space variants. It is also useful in unipath variants to avoid interference between sequence numbers used in probes and the RACK logic. The ACK size improvements do reduce the size of ACKs in presence of out of order delivery, e.g., if the network is doing some kind of internal load balancing. On the other hand, the improvements are somewhat complex, would need to be described in separate drafts, and pretty much contradicts the \"simplicity of code\" argument.\r\n\r\nSo we are left with the \"Null length CID\" issue. I see for cases:\r\n\r\nClient CID | Sender CID | Support | Priority\r\n-----------|------------|-----------|------------\r\nlong | long | Supported in both variants | Used by many implementations\r\nNULL | long | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Preferred configuration of many big deployments\r\nlong | NULL | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Rarely used, server load balancing does not work\r\nNULL | NULL | Does not work for multiple spaces | Only mentioned in some P2P deployments\r\n\r\nThe point here is that it is somewhat hard to deploy a large server with NULL CID and use server load balancing. This configuration is mostly favored by planned P2P deployments.",

The packets from server to client do not carry a CID, and only the last bytes of the sequence number. The client will need some logic to infer the full sequence number before decrypting the packet. The client could maybe use the incoming 5 tuple as part of the logic, but it is not obvious. It is much simpler to assume a direct map from destination CID to number space. That means, if a peer uses a NULL CID, all packets sent to that peer are in the same number space.",

Now, with this proposal, a big part of the problem is solved. The rest of challenge is to make sure single PN remains efficient in terms of ACK and loss recovery. On that part, we plan to do an A/B test and would love to share the results when we get them.\r\n\r\nThere is one more problem as pointed in issue #25 , when we want to take hardware offloads into account. In such a case, we may still need single PN for long server CID.  However, if hardware supports nonce modification, this problem can be addressed with the proposed \"unified solution\".",

At least regarding the \"simplicity of code\" argument, that would be the worst choice.\r\n\r\nIf we can make the multiple packet number spaces solution work with one-sided CIDs, I'm tending toward such an approach. Use of multiple packet number spaces avoids ambiguity/needed \"smartness\" in ACK handling and packet scheduling which, as you say above, can make the implementation more complex and, moreover,  wrong decisions may have large impact on efficient (both local processing and on-the-wire).

Besides ECN, my other concern about single packet number is that it require cleverness from the receiver side if you want to be performant in some scenarios. At the sender-side, you need to consider a path-relative packet number threshold instead of an absolute one to avoid spurious losses.\r\n\r\nJust a point I think we did not mentioned yet is that there can be some interactions between Multipath out-of-order number delivery and incoming packet number duplicate detection. This requires maintaining some state at the receiver side, as described by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-12.3-12. With single packet number space, the receiver should take extra care when updating the \"minimum packet number below which all packets are immediately dropped\". Otherwise, in presence of paths with very different latencies, the receiver might end up discarding packets from a (slower) path.\r\n\r\nI'm also preferring the multiple packet number spaces solution for the above reasons. I'm not against thinking for a \"unified\" solution (the proposal sounds interesting), but I wonder how much complexity this would add compared to requiring end hosts to use one-byte CIDs.",

Nodes that rely on multipath just use long CID and one number space per CID.\r\n* Nodes that use long CID never have to implement the ACK length minimization algorithms.\r\n* Nodes that see a peer using NULL CID have a variety of implementation choices, e.g., sending on just one path at a time, sending on mostly one path at a time in \"make or break\" transitions, or implementing sophisticated algorithms.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, we can get rid of the single vs multiple space discussion, and end up with a single solution addressing all use cases.",

If the connection ID was used by the peer to identify a path from the peer to this endpoint, the resources include the list of received packets used to send acknowledgements. The peer MAY decide to keep sending data using the same IP addresses and UDP ports previously associated with the connection ID, but MUST use a different connection ID when doing so.\r\n\r\n  So retiring associated CID only cause the resources belonging to the corresponding packet number space to be released, but not the whole path to be closed. In CID migration cases, endpoints just want to retire the old CID and use a new one, as path is defined as \"refers to the 4-tuple\"  in the current draft, this operation will not cause the whole path context (including congestion control states, RTT measurements, etc.) to be removed.\r\n\r\n2. Path closing is triggered by PATH_ABANDONED frame, and does not have dependency on CID retiring (Although path closing would trigger the retirement of CID resource). So when path_state transmit from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\", the proper condition might be \"Acknowledgement of PATH_ABANDONED frame received\" or \"Path's draining timeout for at least 3 times the current PTO interval\".\r\n",

          "body": "First, regarding the transitioning from a \"closing\" state to a \"closed\" state, there will be a problem if we use the receipt of the ACK of a PATH_ABANDON as a condition for the transitioning due to possible out-of-order delivery. Suppose a client uses DCID S2 to on its first path to send three pkts with the packet number 100, 101, and 102, where PATH_ABANDON frame is sent in packet 102. However, due to the out-of-order delivery, it is possible that 102 is acked first, while packet 100 and 101 are still in flight. Therefore, at this point, we cannot mark the first path as \"closed\" since it is also possible that the acks of those two packets will later return from the first path. Due to the above reasons, in the initial design, we say that the path should be closed after CIDs are retired. As shown in the path-closing figure (Fig.3) in the draft, after the client makes sure that the packets (100, 101) sent before PATH_ABANDON on path 1 are also acknowledged, it then decides that the CID S2 is no longer needed, and thus sending out the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the transitioning from an \"active\" state to a \"closed\" state, yes, it is possible that we want to retire the old CID and use a new one, and I think the current figure is a bit confusing.  The purpose of this transitioning is to handle exceptions and it basically says that when there are no available CIDs to use for communication on a particular path, we should close it. I think we can simply keep the \"path's timeout\" as the condition because when there are no available CIDs, the path timeout will be triggered anyway.",

We could instead have an intermediate \"Idle\" state in which as long as you have no associated CID, keep relevant recovery/RTT/... contexts.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think it could be worthwhile to make a clearer distinction between the acknowledgment/packet number context and the recovery one. For instance, if for any reason a host changes the DCID used over a given path, it should still keeps track of packets sent with the previous DCID (and thus possibly sent with a different packet number space).\r\n\r\nFor the \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" transition, I tend to agree with Yunfei and I would not directly rely on the acknowledgment of the PATH_ABANDON frame to close my path. But as a sender, I can react to the acknowledgment of my PATH_ABANDON frame and send the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. On the other hand, relying on 3*PTO to transition from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" is probably more relevant than using the path's idle timeout.",

Such value would only be meaningful when it is lower than the advertised `active_connection_id_limit`. And even in such case, it is difficult to enforce that limit. If you provide 8 CIDs to your peer and request `max_paths` to be 2, how would you do that?

If we consider one-sided zero-length CIDs while the other direction uses non-zero-length CIDs, the maximum number of paths is constrained by the `active_connection_id_limit` value of the non-zero-length CID side. If we now consider both sides using zero-length CIDs, then I would keep the minimum of both `active_connection_id_limit` values? RFC9000 states that the host can ignore because it will not send NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames, but we can extend this meaning in the draft. In any case, it might be better to clarify this, and we will likely perform a strong editorial pass on the whole text once we get an agreement on #103.",

Yes, the case of two endpoints both using zero-length CIDs may be under specified. But the deployments of that scenarios are going to be very limited. If the server is part of a frame and uses zero-length CID, the client is identified by its IP address and port. The load balancer will struggle to match the new IP and port of a new path with the original values used in connection establishment. I don't see how that could work. So we are pretty much left to peer to peer scenarios, in which the server is a single computer. Even there, the matching of the new IP and port with the original client requires a combination of guesswork and maybe trial decryption. If developers are ready to do that, they can probably invent a way to manage the path number...",

Imagine a node with a hard limit to maximum two simultaneous paths per connection, but advertising 3 CIDs. With RFC 9000 the only option would be to ignore incoming challenges for new paths.

At that point, we have to infer what is the most likely value of the one way delays that produced this result.\r\n\r\nWhatever the number of paths and number of measurements, the system ends up with fewer equations than variables. For example, even in the single path scenario, a delay of 60 ms can be explained equally well by a delay of 30 ms in each direction, a delay of 40 ms on the send path and 20 ms or the return path, or any combination of delays that sums to 60ms. We can extract bounds, such as \"the delay on segment X is not negative\", but that leaves out a wide range of estimations. This is generally handled by making simple assumptions, such as assuming delays on a given path are symmetric -- until we learn something more.\r\n\r\nEven with that symmetry hypothesis, we have to make hypotheses about the probability function for each path.

However, there is still sth that is not quite clear to me. You mentioned Kalman filter. My understanding is that your state vector is the one-way-delay for each path in each direction. For example, if I have N paths, then I could write down s=[OWD_inbound_1, ...., OWD_inbound_N, OWD_outbound_1,... OWD_outbound_N]. For the process equation, we can write s_(k+1) = s_k + w_k, where w_k is the process noise/disturbance. The difficult part in the problem is that in the observation equation H is a random matrix, which means in each measurement y, y could be the combination of two one-way delays that the combination could change each time. So to me,  at the first glance, the problem is a bit different from the Kalman's formulation whose observation is y = H*s + v, where v is the noise term and H is fixed. I think this is not that relevant, but I am really curious to learn the technique. ",

That would be a bit too CPU intensive. Also, the Kalman filter is trying for a min-square estimate, which works well for Gaussian variables but is only an approximation for the kind of probability distributions that we are likely to encounter. Implementing a more precise Kalman filter would be more precisely wrong...",

When using Identifier Type 0, the Path Identifier corresponds to the sequence number of the Source CID of the sender, hence the sequence number of the Destination CID used by the receiver to send packets on the related path.\r\n\r\nWhile there are obvious values that could be considered as bad and may lead to, e.g., a MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (e.g., a sequence number larger than any sequence number advertised), I don't think we should be as radical with regular values as they might have been retired meanwhile (also possible to face this with packet reordering). The worst edge cases I see are the followings.\r\n\r\nWith type 1, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID in one packet, and then the RETIRE_CID retiring that CID in a subsequent one, but the RETIRE_CID reaches the receiver before the PATH_ABANDON one. If the receiver drops state upon RETIRE_CID reception, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nWith type 0, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID, but before it reaches the peer, the peer sends a RETIRE_CID retiring that CID. If the receiver drops the CID state upon RETIRE_CID sending, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nHandling these edge cases with connection closure is clearly too strong. Still, ignoring or even acknowledging these PATH_ABANDON may have bad consequences. Silently dropping packets (i.e., not acknowledge the packet having PATH_ABANDON) will make the peer retransmit the frame (hoping it updates its path identifier) but could cause the loss/non-acknowledgment of accompanying frames (e.g., STREAM ones), and processing packet content without acknowledging it sounds odd. Acknowledging PATH_ABANDON that cannot be mapped to a path would make some desynchronisation about the status of the path between the peers (the sender now assumes the path is closed, but the receiver not).\r\n\r\nTo address the type 1 issue, we could write some text stating that a sender cannot retire a DCID if a PATH_ABANDON containing the related sequence number is still in flight. But for the type 0, the fix is not obvious (I don't think we could have the same solution as in #135)...",

Sending a packet containing a PING frame restarts the idle timeout for this endpoint also if this is the first ack-eliciting packet sent since receiving a packet. Sending a PING frame causes the peer to respond with an acknowledgment, which also restarts the idle timeout for the endpoint.\r\n\r\nIf you send a PING only one path and don't get a response, you won't reset the timer and might close the connection even though another path might still be alive.

          "body": "@mirjak, you are describing the \"keep alive\" scenario. Yes, keep alive becomes a bit tricky in multipath, because the client may want to select how many paths it wants to keep alive, and which ones. For example, a client with Wi-Fi and cellular may want to keep the cellular path alive, because it will survive a mobility event. It may want to do that even if it is sending traffic over Wi-Fi. That's a local implementation decision. How they do that, however, is straightforward: send a Ping on the path that you want to keep alive.\r\n\r\nI think we should let implementers decide what they want to do. If we do add some text, is should be about keep alive, not about ping. Something like:\r\n```\r\n## Keep Alive\r\n\r\nThe QUIC specification defines an optional keep alive process, see {{Section 5.3 of RFC9000}}.\r\nImplementations of the multipath extension should consider whether this keep alive process\r\nshould be applied to at least one path, all the paths, no path, or a specific subset of the paths.\r\nDifferent applications will likely require different strategies. Once the implementation has\r\ndecided to keep a specific path alive, it can do so by sending Ping frames on that path before\r\nthe idle timeout expires.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

How can the server know which encryption context it should use? The same issue would also happen in the case of NAT rebinding. The server sees a new five tuple, does not know what encryption to apply.\r\n\r\nSo, the first request is to specialize this text to the case in which the client uses zero length CID but the server does not.\r\n\r\nEven in that case, using the five tuple is going to make client-side encryption offload significantly more complex. The offload engines will have to remember all the five tuples used in the connection, and the corresponding keys. This is a new requirement, and it may be difficult to meet by many implementations.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much simpler to accept the limitation: using multiple number spaces requires that both sides use non-null connection IDs.",

The clarity part is a matter of taste; the subtle deviations need discussion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, to process. Since the DPRIVE WG has not adopted a fully GitHub based process, the preferred method for requesting changes is by having a discussion on the WG mailing list. If we did adopt a GitHub based process, we should probably first migrate this depot to an IETF managed account. Then, we should make clear that discussions should start by opening an issue, not a pull request. Issues allow presentation of the problem before text changes and the archival of those discussions, pull requests are not designed for that. They should come later, when the issue has outlined a consensus for change.",

We have two cases.\r\n\r\n1. 1 sent on B, 2 sent on A\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-cases here.\r\n\r\n- The receiver sends an ACK before having received 2. `ACK(largest=1)` contains the ACK delay relative to path B. Then it receives 2, and sends `ACK(largest=2)` with ACK delay relative to path A. In this case, we have ACK delay for both paths.\r\n\r\n- The receiver waited for 2 before sending its ACK. Then, the ACK delay of `ACK(largest=2)` relates to path A, and we don't have the host delay of path B.\r\n\r\n2. 1 sent on A, 2 sent on B\r\n\r\nWhile we still have the two sub-cases, they both lead to the same result: `ACK(largest=2, missing=1)` and `ACK(largest=2)` have their ACK delay relative to the host delay of path B and not to the path A.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the largest packet number has been sent on the lowest latency path, it will prevent the receiver from advertising the host delay of higher latency paths. Note that the \"ideal case\" (where both paths have estimates) only works if the sender does not transmit further packets on the fast path, in which case we fall into case 2. As the fast path will get its packets acknowledged quicker, the sender will likely send further packets on fast path first. It might still be possible to get host delay estimates of slower paths, but most of the ACK delays will relate to the fast one.",

The new text essentially adds \"do not send if no non-probing packet received or acknowledged over 3 RTT.\" At first sight it looks right, but there is a tension. Suppose that, as a receiver, I wish the sender would stop sending on a path. With the old rule, I can simply stop sending on that path. With the new rule, I would have to also stop acknowledging packets, even if those packets were received correctly. That's not natural, a tension between signalling path preference and creating artificial losses. All considered, I would rather keep the old text.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that if I am a receiver that wants to proactively cause a sender to stop sending, I should use the explicit way of sending a path abandon frame. The idle timeout handles the case when a receiver is unaware of a path change that leads to communication failure. If that is the purpose, as long as the receiver can receive packets in the sender-to-receiver direction and acknowledge on another path, it looks to me that we should still allow the sender to use that path. But I feel if we do that, we are diverging from the bidirectional nature of a path described in the draft, which worths more discussion.",

This sentence covers the case where a path was idle for a while and therefore should be closed silently as it might not work anymore anyway. However, if you have received packet on the path or have an indication that packets you've sent on the path were received by the other end, the path is clearly not idle and working.

We want to say that receiving data in one direction proves that the receiving direction works, and receiving acknowledgements proves that the sending direction works. Stop sending should logically be tied to the sending direction. If packets sent on a path are not acked, then the node should stop sending because the path is probably broken. But isn't that already covered? \r\n\r\nI think the text mixes two issues: stop sending because the path is broken; and, stop sending because the peer would rather not use it anymore. The peer not sending \"non probing\" data on the path may be an indication that it does not want to use it anymore. Or it may be an indication that it has nothing to send right now. Which means the signal is ambiguous, and using ambiguous signals is a bad idea. I think we should come down to two simple ideas:\r\n\r\n* nodes should monitor the quality of paths. If packets sent on the path are not acked, that means the quality is bad and the path should probably not be used.\r\n* nodes that want they peer to stop using a specific path should signal it using \"abandon path\" frame.",

Therefore please note that this PR proposes to add this text to the respective section for single PNS considerations. We can add more text about general ECN but that shouldn't be much different from normal QUIC operation and would be a separate PR for a different section of the document.  \r\n\r\n> Yes, in the case of single number space, that does mean single counter for all paths, and that makes the signal harder to use in congestion control.\r\n\r\nI don't think \"harder to use\" is right. If multiple packets from different paths are ack'ed in the same frame it's simply impossible to assign the signal to one path. As you never should just ignore a congestion signal, the most conservative but probably only correct reaction is unfortunately to reduce your cwnd on all paths where packet got ack'ed. \r\n\r\n> just not use ECN, i.e., send all packets with ECN flags \"00\".\r\n\r\nYes, that is an option and I can add this. This was actually my first thought (see my reply in issue #87). However, for me that would be a strong argument against the single PNS solution. But then I thought that if the receiver would send separate ACKs per path that could also address the problem and keeping ACKs separated per path (at least if the sender sends blocks of PNs on each path) might be beneficial anyway. I think that also something that Ian had in mind.\r\n\r\n> use ECN on only some path, e.g., the one path on which most data is sent, mark packets on this path with ECT-0 or ECT-1, mark packets on the other paths as \"00\".\r\n\r\nThat means you could only see ECN on one path. I don't think this an appropriate solution and again would be reason for me to not go for the single PNS solution.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 on one path, ECT-1 on the other, and use some logic to attribute ECN counts to either ECT-0 or ECT-1.\r\n\r\nI think this is out of scope for this document as it makes a different use of ECT1 against the recommendation in RFC8311 (and in conflict with L4S). So if you want to propose this, you have to go to tsvwg.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 or ECT-1 on all paths, and use correlation with other factors (e.g., losses, delays) to allocate the ECN marks to different paths.\r\n\r\nI don't think this could work. You don't have per packet delay information in the ACK, so that exactly the same ambiguity. And ideally loss should not be correlated with ECN - hopefully you have ECN instead of loss but that also not guaranteed as you might have multiple bottlenecks or other reason for loss.",

For example, when we want to use re-injection in our packet scheduling, we need to make sure that a packet sent on path 1 can also be reinjected on path 2. Therefore, what we did was to use per-path PMTU discovery and the use the minimum PMTU of all paths for each individual path. But indeed, this choice may vary in a different implementation.",

Yes we don't specify a way to learn server addresses but that doesn't means that the client doesn't know (e.g. based on higher layer information) multiple addresses of the server.

          "body": "There are two parts in this PR.\r\n\r\nFirst, the following sentences:\r\n\r\nThis extension does not change the definition of any transport parameter\r\ndefined in {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. \r\nInline with the definition in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} disable_active_migration\r\nalso disables multipath support, except \"after a client has acted on a\r\npreferred_address transport parameter\" {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.\r\n\r\nThese sentences are at the right place. I would replace \"any\" by \"all the\" but that's a detail.\r\n\r\nFor the second part, I think that we should solve this problem differently. The current text is the following:\r\n\r\nFurther, it is out of scope for\r\nthis document if the old address can also be used for multipath\r\nafter a client has migrated to the address provided in the preferred_address\r\ntransport parameter. However, it SHOULD NOT be assumed that it is\r\npossible to use both addresses simultaneously without further confirmation\r\nfrom the other host.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to discuss somewhere in the document how the client learns the server address and how preferred address is used. Since we do not have a way for the server to convey the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses in this document, I would suggest a simple approach:\r\n- When preferred address is not used, then the client can only establish multipath flows to the server address\r\n- When preferred address is used, then if a client migrates to one of the preferred addresses according to 9.6 of RFC9000, then it must consider this address as the endpoint of all multipath flows\r\n\r\nI guess that we'll need to define later a transport parameter that provides the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses of a given server. In the mean time, we should opt for a simple solution.",

There are in fact two pieces to that: logic at the receiver, i.e., the node that chose to receive packets with zero-length CID; and logic at the sender, i.e., the node that accepts to send data on multiple paths towards a node that uses zero-length CID. This is explained in details in the section \"Using Zero-Length connection ID\", so I guess what we need is a reference to that section.",

The path_id_type field in the PATH_ABANDON frame is also added in the figure to give an idea how the type is used. Moreover, one case for single PN is added (where the client receives zero-length CID while the server receives long CID). According to previous discussion, in the single PN case, only the client needs to send out a PATH_ABANDON. The server SHOULD stop sending new data on the path indicated by the PATH_ABANDON frame after receiving it. However, The client may want to repeat the\r\nPATH_ABANDON frame if it sees the server continuing to send data. It is optional for the server to respond with a PATH_ABANDON after it receives a PATH_ABANDON frame from the client. ",

Or the max value of \"ACK Timer\" and \"Path RTT / 2\". Reset that timer for each path after sending an on path RTT. Then, trigger an on path ACK as soon as (1) the timer has expired and (2) a packet has been received.
